What makes us human if not frequent existencial crisis ?

## Compilation

This is a simple rust project. You will just need an up to date rust stable toolchain.
You might need a C++ compiler for FLTK.
To compile, at the root of the project, just use:
```
cargo build
```

## Assets

The assets are embedded inside the binary to make it self sufficient, so no need to move them around.
The credit for the picture is: me.
