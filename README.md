# Captcha-cha-cha

Dear  Kurisu, your fri̊ends at the Mindless Cyberspace have heard your call for help.
To assist you in your battle against CERN, we design not one, but two new captcha system.
These are rough proof-of concept made in a hurry, so our apologies for the rough edge.

## Capt3cha

This system use the fact that, since they are cyberspace-native, AI struggle ẘith 3d space.
You will find the source co̊de and more technical details in it director̊y `capt3cha/`, and a 
pre-compiled binary in `bin/`.

It use a custom made OpenGL 3d engine, and therefore, require 3d harware acceleration. 
If you are using a VM, mak̊e sure you have 3d accel enabled.

## Existanchå

To filt̊er-out bot, we have to think about what separate them from us. What makes us human ?
This c̊aptcha system use a e̊motional, excistencial approach to r̊oot out those pesky emotionless AI.
The source code in available in the folder `existancha/` and the pre-compiled binary at `bin/`.

## PS: It's not all

A third captcha as been hidden in this repo to keep it out of sight from any CERN AI.

Look for clues hidden̊ in plain-sight.

El Psy Congroo !
